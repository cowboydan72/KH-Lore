        <h1>The Entire Lore of Kingdom Hearts</h1>
        <p>The goal of this project is to have one document that covers the lore of <em>all</em> of the games that someone with no knowledge of Kingdom Hearts can understand</p>
        <h2>Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover</h2>
            <p>This is the first entry in the kingdom hearts timeline leading up to the events of the browser games and inevitably the great keyblade war.  The master of masters and his six apprentices are all keyblade wielders in Daybreak Town.  Each of his apprentices trains and leads a union of future keyblade wielders which will come into play in the following games.  The master of masters can see the future, so he makes a book of prophecies and gives copies to five of his six apprentices and gives each of them a role.  Ira is to replace the master as leader because he is to disappear soon.  After the master vanishes, Ira discovers darkness among the apprentices and suspects someone is a traitor.  Aced gets offended at the idea and storms off.  Invi’s role is to manage group morale and they find out from Ira that there is no mention of this in the book of prophecies and a page is missing from everyone’s books.  Aced proposed a secret alliance between him, Gula, and Ava which only Gula agreed to.  Ira finds out and tries to get Gula to disband the alliance but Aced learns Ira asked him to leave and is outraged.  Aced’s role is to support Ira and take action if he believes he is unfit to lead and he is convinced there is no traitor and Ira is unfit.  He fights Invi in his rage which makes everyone suspicious of him and then Gula reveals his role.  He had the missing page and was to use it to find the traitor, but him having the page draws more suspicion onto him.  Gula accuses Aced and then they fight too, but in the end Ira only suspects Gula.  The unions begin collecting lux to level up and summon kingdom hearts to bring the master back.  Ava’s role was to collect the best keyblade wielders and scatter them across the worlds as an attempt to prevent the keyblade war and it also prevents the other unions from gaining much power.  In the end there was no traitor, but their paranoia is what causes the keyblade war despite Ava’s efforts.  Luxu, the final apprentice, has been watching everything unfold as the master of masters gave him a keyblade called the No Name with the master’s eye which lets him see into the future and told him to find an apprentice.  Before he finds an apprentice he has to hide a mysterious black box which is never found and we never learn the contents of.  His keyblade is passed down to his apprentice and his apprentice passes the keyblade down to Xehanort which starts the rest of the series.</p>
        <h2>Kingdom Hearts χ[chi]</h2>
            <p>Kingdom Hearts χ[chi] takes place at the same time as the events of Kingdom Hearts χ back cover except told from the perspective of a union member.  The MC is sent to a location known as dive to the heart which is a dreamlike place and a manifestation of the heart, often serving as a tutorial area.  In dive to the heart the MC chooses which of the apprentices’, now known as foretellers, unions they would like to join not including Luxu’s.  The player is sent to Daybreak Town with a keyblade where they are attacked by heartless and saved by their foreteller who chases down the heartless leaving the MC alone with Chirithy.  Chirithy explains that the MC is to fight the darkness and they have been assigned as your aide to check your progress.  Chirithy explains that cards unlock a keyblade’s true potential with different skills and MC learns moogles collect and sell these cards.  MC’s foreteller tells them to fight heartless and collect lux to power up but to be wary of the other unions as their wills do not align with ours.  As MC travels between worlds fighting heartless Chirithy recounts the tale of the master of masters and the books of prophecies up until the keyblade war because it hasn’t happened just yet.  MC meets Ephemer, a keyblade wielder from another union, back in Daybreak Town and they decide to break into the foretellers’ chamber.  Ephemer is nowhere to be found but MC breaks in anyway and has to fight Ava and is easily defeated and tells MC to go home.  Later, in Beast’s Castle, MC meets Skuld who is another keyblade wielder from Ephemer’s union.  Skuld and MC invade the foreteller’s lair where they find 2 foretellers fighting, presumably Aced and one other.  In the lair they meet a nightmare Chirithy who informs them heartless are keyblade wielders that were consumed by the darkness.  MC and Skuld re-enter the foretellers’ chamber where they are confronted by Ava who tells them Ephemer has turned traitor.  They fight and lose but Ava reveals that she is collecting the strongest keyblade wielders and sending them to the realm of light in order to avoid the keyblade war and that Ephemer is there and Skuld and MC are worthy to join him.  Accusations of lux stealing between unions arise leading to MC fighting Aced and losing, Ira discovers the fight and tells MC the war is inevitable, and convinces them and Skuld to find Gula.  Gula tells them only the master of masters could avert such a crisis, but he and Luxu disappeared.  Meanwhile Ava finds Luxu and when she learns there was no traitor she fights him and rings the clock bell signaling the start of the war.  Skuld returns to her union for the war leaving MC with nightmare Chirithy who scolds them for avoiding the war and summons a corrupted heartless to kill them.  MC wins and nightmare Chirithy dissolves, vowing to return.  The keyblade war really begins a few days later and MC fights the foretellers and barely survives eventually falling unconscious.  Many keyblade wielders died creating the location later known as the Keyblade Graveyard.  He wakes up in a simulation of the Enchanted Dominion, the sleeping beauty world.  Chirithy claims the keyblade war was just a dream the MC has been having since he declined Ava’s offer of going to the realm of light.  MC and Chirithy rest by a wall of thorns where Maleficent can be heard plotting to conquer this new world as Sora cannot seem to interfere here, and it is heavily implied that she now has a book of prophecies.</p>
        <h2>Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ</h2>
            <p>Because most of the events of Kingdom Hearts χ[chi] were revealed to be mostly a dream, Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ is the actual occurrence of all of the events in MC’s dream from denying Ava’s invitation to the realm of light up until the keyblade war where the next game kicks off.</p>
        <h2>Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross]</h2>
            <p>Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross] starts just before the keyblade war.  Strelitzia is a member of Ava’s union, the Dandelions, and has been selected to be one of the new union leaders after the war.  She attempts to convince MC to join them but is soon killed by an unknown individual who steals her rulebook, an item given by Ava to any future union leaders that details the master of masters rules.  With it, this unknown individual claims Strelitzia’s place as a union leader.  After the keyblade war, Ephemer and Skuld save MC bringing them to a new realm where all the Dandelions are gathering at Ava’s request.  Everyone but the five new union leaders lose their memories of the previous world altogether upon entering the new realm.  Following Ava’s orders, the five new union leaders, Brain, Ventus, Lauriam, Ephemer, and Skuld, gather at the Keyblade Graveyard.  From there they return to the foretellers’ chamber and form union x to unite the unions and prevent another keyblade war.  To celebrate they synthesize spirits, otherwise known as dream eaters, that “eat” bad dreams and nightmares like Chirithy.  Meanwhile MC completes their missions, reliving the events leading up to the keyblade war.  MC pairs up with members of the newly formed union x and begins having nightmares of the keyblade war more and more frequently.  Chirithy warns Ephemer and Skuld about the nightmares and they tell them to keep MC in the dark.  Then Ephemer and Skuld leave to investigate a new impending darkness in the world.  Maleficent had somehow managed to travel back in time but was upset when she learned she could not conquer her world in the past.  Soon after an unknown figure referred to as Darkness explains that this world is only a simulation and she is a danger to it because of her knowledge of the future.  So he instructs her to find the lifeboat at the center of Daybreak Town that will take her back out of the simulation.  Lauriam confronts Maleficent while investigating Strelitzia’s disappearance and is defeated letting Maleficent escape.  Darkness tells Maleficent to use another pod to return to the future after she returns to the real world.  Daybreak Town starts experiencing glitches as it was forcibly connected to another world.  While scouring the Book of Prophecies for solutions, Brain finds the master’s list and learns Ventus was not meant to be a union leader.  Lauriam begins fighting with the group over Strelitzia’s disappearance and eventually Ventus reveals that he killed her.  Darkness reveals himself from Ventus and the others learn he was possessed and killed her against his will.</p>
        <h2>Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road</h2>
            <p>While technically the same game as Kingdom Hearts Union χ[Cross], Kingdom Hearts Union χ Dark Road is an update that covers a different plotline.  It covers Xehanort’s beginnings.  He grew up on Destiny Island questioning the existence of other worlds until a mysterious hooded figure, later revealed to be his own heartless Ansem, tells him he is destined to explore other worlds.  Ansem opens a portal to Scala ad Caelum, a world built on the ruins of Daybreak Town where keyblade wielders are trained and he sends Xehanort through.  Much later, Xehanort and his five keyblade wielder classmates are confronted by their master Odin.  He instructs the six to scour the worlds for seven upperclassmen who have gone missing before their mark of mastery exam, an exam that makes a keyblade wielder into a master.  Xehanort and his classmates explore knowing many of these worlds are still forming after the keyblade war and that they are not to meddle in other worlds’ affairs.  In his travels, Xehanort and his classmate Eraqus discover Wonderland where the Queen of Hearts resides consumed by darkness.  They never find the missing classmates and 4 years later Xehanort decides to leave Eraqus to discover what master Odin never showed them.  He returns to Wonderland to investigate the Queen who is still possessed by darkness and has forgotten him entirely.  Some time later he began travelling through corridors of darkness, which are gateways to other worlds powered by darkness, and the darkness in them began to infect his heart.</p>
        <h2>Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep</h2>
            <p>Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep begins in the Land of Departure featuring three new characters, Terra, Aqua, and Ventus.  These three are training under Master Xehanort’s friend Eraqus to become keyblade masters.  Aqua and Terra take the mark of mastery exam together but terra fails due to the high amount of darkness in his heart.  The creatures known as Unversed start to appear and Master Xehanort disappears.  Terra is sent to destroy them and find Master Xehanort, Ventus follows him as he was convinced to by Master Xehanort’s masked apprentice Vanitas.  Eraqus sends Aqua to keep Terra from falling into darkness and to bring Ventus back.  The three travel through Disney worlds fighting Unversed and meet Mickey Mouse, who is also fighting them, and his master, Yen Sid.  Terra’s darkness increases as he makes deals with several villains in exchange for Master Xehanort’s whereabouts.  He concludes Master Xehanort is after the seven princesses of heart and tries to draw him out by having Aqua strengthen the light in their hearts.  The three reunite at Radiant Garden where Aqua meets Kairi and strengthens her light.  Aqua and Ventus confront Terra about the growing darkness in him, but Terra distances himself.  Terra and Aqua eventually make it to Destiny Islands, the home of our protagonist for most of the other games, Sora, and of course his friend Riku.  Terra sees potential in Riku and gives him the power to one day wield a keyblade as Aqua did with Kairi.  At the same time, Ventus finds Master Xehanort, who reveals he plans to use Ventus’s heart to create the x-blade, and pins the blame on Eraqus.  When Ventus returns to the Land of Departure, Eraqus tries to erase him to prevent Master Xehanort’s plans from coming to fruition.  Terra was sent there by Master Xehanort and he misinterprets the situation and saves Ventus.  Master Xehanort kills Eraqus soon after and tells Terra to go to the Keyblade Graveyard and be consumed by darkness.  Back at Destiny Islands, Ventus runs into Vanitas again and learns he was once Master Xehanort’s apprentice but he was deemed too frail so his darkness was extracted from him to create Vanitas.  Vanitas then tells him to join Terra at the Keyblade Graveyard.  Yen Sid tells Aqua of Eraqus’s death and instructs her to go there as well.  After all three are gathered there, Master Xehanort and Vanitas appear and reveal his plan to use the x-blade to unlock kingdom hearts unleashing the secrets of the keyblade war onto other worlds.  He also planned to use Terra as a vessel to live long enough to see his plans come about.  Master Xehanort freezes Ventus and Vanitas knocks out Aqua, enraging Terra which unleashed the darkness in his heart.  This allowed Master Xehanort to unlock his heart and transfer it into Terra’s unstable body resulting in the birth of Young Xehanort.  Terra’s mind stayed in his armor which came to life in a form known as Lingering Will and defeated Xehanort.  Ventus thaws himself before Aqua can be killed and discovers Vanitas is the source of the Unversed.  Vanitas possesses Ventus then they merge creating the x-blade, Aqua and Mickey fight possessed Ventus while he fights Vanitas from within the vessel.  Aqua shatters the x-blade as Ventus beats Vanitas which ends the Unversed but sacrifices Ventus’s heart.  The destruction of the x-blade scatters everyone through corridors of space except for Lingering Will.  Mickey saves Aqua and Ventus and brings them back to Master Yen Sid’s Mysterious Tower where they learn Ventus cannot wake up without his heart.  Aqua finds Eraqus’s keyblade back at the Land of Departure and uses it to unlock the Chamber of Waking and reshapes the world into Castle Oblivion.  Aqua leaves Ventus in the chamber and goes to fight Xehanort in Radiant Garden.  After the fight Xehanort tries to unlock his heart making him lose all his memories and sending Terra’s body into darkness.  Aqua dives into the darkness to save Terra-Xehanort but it is too much for her glider, so she sends it back up with Terra-Xehanort and her armor to guide it leaving herself in the Realm of Darkness.  Ansem the Wise, ruler of Radiant Garden, discovers Xehanort and takes him on as an apprentice.  Meanwhile, Ventus’s wandering heart merges with Sora’s.  Aqua is overwhelmed by the sheer number of Heartless in the Realm of Darkness and allows them to destroy her.  She is saved by Terra and Ventus’s keyblades and continues on with the hope of finding her friends.  The secret ending shows Eraqus’s heart locked within Terra’s, and the hearts of Terra and Xehanort lying dormant in Xehanort’s old body.  Shortly after the events of Kingdom Hearts II, Aqua can be seen with Ansem the Wise in the Dark Margin, an area at the edge of the Realm of Darkness.  Ansem has lost most of his memories but he informs that there is hope to be found in Sora.</p>
